      An elf (plural: elves) is a type of humanlike supernatural being in
      Germanic mythology and folklore. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures,
      elves seem generally to have been thought of as beings with magical powers
      and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of
      either helping or hindering them.However, the details of these beliefs
      have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both
      pre-Christian and Christian cultures. <br /><br />
      pre-Christian and Christian cultures. The word elf is found throughout the
      Germanic languages and seems originally to have meant 'white being'.
      Reconstructing the early concept of an elf depends largely on texts,
      written by Christians, in Old and Middle English, medieval German, and Old
      Norse. These associate elves variously with the gods of Norse mythology,
      with causing illness, with magic, and with beauty and seduction.
      <br /><br />
      After the medieval period, the word elf tended to become less common
      throughout the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms
      like Zwerg ("dwarf") in German and huldra ("hidden being") in Scandinavian
      languages, and to loan-words like fairy (borrowed from French into most of
      the Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in the early
      modern period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were
      thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly,
      alongside everyday human communities. They continued to be associated with
      causing illnesses and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early
      modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the
      medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human
      characters. <br /><br />With urbanisation and industrialisation in the
      nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly
      (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves).
      However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be
      prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary
      elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with William Shakespeare's A
      Midsummer Night's Dream being a key development of this idea. In the
      eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by this
      notion of the elf, and reimported the English word elf into the German
      language. <br /><br />From this Romanticist elite culture came the elves
      of popular culture that emerged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
      The "Christmas elves" of contemporary popular culture are a relatively
      recent creation, popularized during the late nineteenth-century in the
      United States. Elves entered the twentieth-century high fantasy genre in
      the wake of works published by authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien; these
      re-popularised the idea of elves as human-sized and humanlike beings.
      Elves remain a prominent feature of fantasy books and games nowadays.
